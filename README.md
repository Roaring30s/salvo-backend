_Salvo Backend_
===============

Description
-----------

Salvo Financial is a platform that makes investing in crypto passive income opportunities an easy task.

Many elements such as setting slippage, swapping tokens, and adjusting gas are all done under the hood permitting the novice crypto investor to enter the industry.

Salvo Financial plans to become the training wheels of crypto investing making the process as easy and seamless as possible.

**Challenges:** This was my second freelance gig where I had to pick up the Solidity programming language and quickly learn Solidity security best practices.

Using AVAX, Avalanche's native currency, an investor can invest said token into liquidity pools with the click of a button. Investing in liquidity pools earns the investor weekly interest.

The smart contracts contained in the repo allow the movement of invested AVAX from the platform to Trader Joe and Vector Finance to stake the liquidity and boost returns respectively.

**Technologies:** Backend - Solidity
